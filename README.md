# Machine-learning

in this project i have some data iris.xls 
i tested my data with six below machine learning algorithms and I caluculated the R_score and also confusion_matrix
for this data which algorithm is greet then other
algorithms are:
Logistic Regression,KNN Classifier,Decision tree classifier,Random Forest Classifier,SVM Classification,Naive Bayes Classification

Logistic regression 
score: 0.84
confusion_matrix
[[16  0  0]
 [ 0 13  6]
 [ 0  2 13]]
KNN 
score : 0.96
confusion_matrix
[[16  0  0]
 [ 0 18  1]
 [ 0  1 14]]
Decision tree 
score: 0.96
confusion_matrix
[[16  0  0]
 [ 0 18  1]
 [ 0  1 14]]
Random forest 
score: 0.94
confusion_matrix
[[16  0  0]
 [ 0 18  1]
 [ 0  2 13]]
SVM 
score: 0.96
confusion_matrix
[[16  0  0]
 [ 0 18  1]
 [ 0  1 14]]
Gaussian Naive bayes 
score: 0.96
confusion_matrix
[[16  0  0]
 [ 0 19  0]
 [ 0  2 13]]
